There has been a lot of baseless riffle raffle in the lying liberal media on the importance of 'saving the bees' In this essay I will explain why that is absolutely preposterous.</p> </div></div>

                        <p class="Black-text flow-text">For a start, the bees are a liberal cabal of secretely lizard oligarchs planing to rule the wolrd with an iron fist that have links to extremists such as Godzilla and Al-Quaeda. There are many clues that point us to this, the first being their stingers, who needs something like that if you're not evil? Secondly they are clearly masters of disguise as they have convinced the general population, using the lying leftist media and well-known centrist Ben Shapiro that they are cute because of their adorable fuzzy appearence, and they are right? WRONG!

                        <p class="Black-text flow-text">Disguise and destraction is the primary method employed by the ðŸ…±ees to get away with their heinous activities and cause havoc and discord amongst the monkes.

                        <p class="Black-text flow-text">In addition to this, bees look stoopid. This is for a number of reasons. Number 1 is that they need to pick up a colour and stick to it, yellow and black? Cringe!
                        </p>
                        <p class="Black-text flow-text">Number 2 is that they can't choose an aethetic, they start off with th cut bumbly fuzzy body that tricks you. Then they have these weird gross legs and wings and the stinger. Also they are ugly.

                <p class="Black-text flow-text">Monke good, bear bad. It is a simple principle, but one rooted in deep philosophical principles. Monkeys are worship in many religions, most notably stop motion animation with the great deity King Kong, also Sun Wukong the Monky king in chinese mytholgy who is based. Bears are simply put inferior, while I do not believe they share the same outright evil secrets of bees, they're simply not as good.
